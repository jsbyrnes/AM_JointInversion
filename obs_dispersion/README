Observed phase velocity data, downloaded 2019.08.19

Ambient noise from Ekstrom, 2017, PEPI, doi:/10.1016/j.pepi.2017.07.010
  - Vertical component Rayleigh wave observations at 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15s
  - Other periods are available at >= 20s, but this overlaps with ASWMS
  - Data from www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~ekstrom/Projects/ANT/USANT15
  - The files contain phase-velocity maps of Love and Rayleigh waves
    derived from USArray data for the period 2006-2015 using
    noise-tomography techniques. This set of phase-velocity maps are
    referred to as "USANT15".
  - Each file contains a line close to the beginning that looks like
      #PVELREF: x.xxxx
    This line gives the reference phase velocity for the anomaly
    values that follow.
  - The files contain values of phase velocity for latitude-longitude
    pixels. Variations are given in percent. The format of the data is
    latitude, longitude, pixel size in degrees, percent deviation.
    The latitude and longitude refer to the center of the pixel.
  - The pixel map is referenced to geocentric coordinates.  Therefore
    the latitude should be corrected to the ellipsoid if maps are
    plotted in geographic coordinates.

  - Data from https://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/aswms/
  - Use the Helmholtz (corrected) measurements for Rayleigh waves
  - Periods available: 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100 s
  - File name format: 'helmholtz_stack_LHZ_[dd].xyz', where [dd] is 20, ..., 100
  - Each line in the files contains one phase-velocity observation.
    The columns:
      1. Latitude
      2. Longitude
      3. Phase velocity

I assume that these lat/lons are geographic.

Supplementary Information from Babikoff & Dalton, 2019.  There are nine phase
velocity map files for the nine periods measured. The period is specified in
the file name. Each file contains three columns with the following format:
latitude, longitude, phase velocity in m/s.

 - File names are in the format c_[period]s_BD19
 - Periods available: 25, 40, 50, 60, 100, 120, 140, 180
